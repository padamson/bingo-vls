# NRL Bingo

This is an adaptation of another Bingo game found on github.

Replace the words in the `words.js` file with your own ones. Keep the first and last line!

Like this:
```
const words = `

Here comes your own bs
Each one goes in a separate line

`;
```

Open the `index.html` in a browser. Every time you refresh the page it will generate a new Bingo card.  
Print it or play it on your laptop. Have fun! :wink:
